title: "Services UI Composition primer"
author: Mauro Servienti
synopsis: "When designing distributed systems we strive for separation and autonomy on the back end, but on the front end this all needs to come back together. How do we stop it from turning into a mess of spaghetti code? How do we prevent simple actions from causing an inefficient torrent of web requests? Let's start by understanding what Services UI Composition is and how you can architect front end to be Microservices ready."
