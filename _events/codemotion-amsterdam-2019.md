- title: "The road to a Service Oriented Architecture is paved with messages"
  abstract: "One of the options on the table when implementing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), or the communication style across multiple microservices, is based on messages and a service bus. This talk will drive you through the basic SOA building blocks, introduce message based architectures, and will connect the dots between technology and architectural principles through some samples using NServiceBus."

- title: "Design a UI for your Microservices"
  abstract: "How do we design a UI when the back-end system consists of dozens (or more) microservices? We have separation and autonomy on the back end, but on the front end this all needs to come back together. How do we stop it from turning into a mess of spaghetti code? How do we prevent simple actions from causing an inefficient torrent of web requests? Join Mauro in building a Composite UI for Microservices from scratch, using .NET Core. Walk away with a clear understanding of what Services UI Composition is and how you can architect front end to be Microservices ready."
  language: "English"
- title: "All our aggregates are wrong"
  abstract: "It always starts well. At first glance the requirements seem straightforward, and implementation proceeds without hiccups. Then it starts to get more complex, and you find yourself in a predicament, introducing technical shortcuts that smell for the sake of delivering the new feature on schedule. We'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. We'll focus our attention to the business needs and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing the feature. Walk away with a new understanding on how to take requirements apart to build the right software."
