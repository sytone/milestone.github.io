- title: "All our aggregates are wrong"
  abstract: "It always starts well. At first glance the requirements seem straightforward, and implementation proceeds without hiccups. Then it starts to get more complex, and you find yourself in a predicament, introducing technical shortcuts that smell for the sake of delivering the new feature on schedule. We'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. We'll focus our attention to the business needs and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing the feature. Walk away with a new understanding on how to take requirements apart to build the right software."

- title: "Welcome to the (state) machine"
  abstract: "Stateless all the thing, they say. In the last few years weâ€™ve been brainwashed that stateful is bad. However complex software systems need to do collaborative processing, that is stateful by definition. This is when Sagas come into play. Sagas allows to model complex collaborative domains without the need for distributed transactions and coordination. Join Mauro on a journey that aims to disclose what sagas are, how they can be used to model a complex collaborative domain, and what role they play when it comes to designing systems with failure and eventual consistency in mind."
